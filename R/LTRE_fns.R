## Main LTRE functions


# a wrapper function for classical LTRE:
#' Classical LTRE analysis
#'
#' Life Table Response Experiments (LTREs) are a method of comparative demographic
#' analysis. The purpose is to quantify how the difference or variance in vital
#' rates (stage-specific survival, growth, and fertility) amongst populations
#' contributes to difference or variance in the population growth rate, "lambda."
#' The equations and descriptions for the classical methods of LTRE analysis
#' can be found in Caswell's 2001 textbook. The function we provide here can
#' perform a one-way fixed design LTRE, or a random design LTRE.
#'
#' @param Aobj An object containing all the population projection matrices to be
#'  included in the analysis. It should either be a list, or a matrix where each
#'   row is the column-wise vectorization of a matrix.
#'
#'  For one-way fixed design, exactly 2 matrices must be provided, ordered as
#'  `[reference matrix, treatment matrix`]. For random design, any set of 2 or
#'  more matrices can be provided. The set of matrices passed in to this
#'  function must all have the same dimensions.
#'
#' @param method Either "random" or "fixed." The default behavior is "random."
#' See details for more information.
#'
#' @return A matrix of contributions to variance (random design) or difference
#' (one-way fixed design) in lambda. Lambda is the asymptotic population growth
#' rate, defined as the largest eigenvalue of the population projection matrix.
#'
#' @export
#'
#'@details  Lambda is the asymptotic population growth rate, defined as the
#'  largest eigenvalue of the population projection matrix. A one-way fixed
#'  design LTRE decomposes the difference in lambda due to differences at each
#'  position of the matrices. It should be used when the particular treatment
#'  levels are of interest. For a one-way fixed design LTRE, exactly 2 matrices
#'  must be provided, ordered as `[reference matrix, treatment matrix`]. The
#'  matrix of contributions returned from a classical method fixed design LTRE
#'  will have the same shape as the provided matrices.
#'
#'  A random design LTRE decomposes the variance in lambda due to variance and
#'  covariance in the entries at each position in the matrices. It assumes that
#'  the matrices being analyzed come from a population of similar matrices,
#'  without the particular treatment levels or population conditions being of
#'  interest per se. For a random design LTRE, at least 2 matrices must be
#'  provided. The matrix of contributions returned from a classical method
#'  random design LTRE will include both first-order terms (due to variance) and
#'  interaction terms (due to covariance). Therefore, if the provided matrix is
#'  3x3, the matrix of contributions will be 9x9 (the size of the
#'  variance-covariance matrix is the square of the size of the original
#'  matrix). The contributions of variances are found on the diagonal of the
#'  contribution matrix, and the contributions of covariances are symmetric. So
#'  the contribution of covariance between two vital rate parameters is the sum
#'  of the two corresponding off-diagonal terms.
#'
#'  The equations and descriptions for the classical methods of LTRE analysis
#'  can be found in Caswell's 2001 textbook.

# A wrapper function for exact LTRE:
#' Exact LTRE analysis
#'
#' Life Table Response Experiments (LTREs) are a method of comparative demographic
#' analysis. The purpose is to quantify how the difference or variance in vital
#' rates (stage-specific survival, growth, and fertility) amongst populations
#' contributes to difference or variance in the population growth rate, "lambda."
#' The exact method of LTRE is based on the principles of functional ANOVA.
#' The equations and descriptions for the exact method will be published in a
#' forthcoming paper, which we will link to.
#'
#' @param Aobj An object containing all the population projection matrices to be
#'  included in the analysis. It should either be a list, or a matrix where each
#'   row is the column-wise vectorization of a matrix.
#'
#'  For one-way fixed design, exactly 2 matrices must be provided. For a
#'  "directional" analyses, one of the provided matrices will serve as the
#'  baseline state (for example, a control or standard-of-reference). In this
#'  case, the matrices need to be ordered as `[baseline matrix, observed matrix`].
#'  For random design, any set of 2 or more matrices can be provided.
#'  The set of matrices passed in must all have the same dimensions.
#'
#' @param method Either "random" or "fixed." The default behavior is "random."
#' See details for more information.
#'
#' @param maxint The maximum interaction order to be evaluated. The default input
#' is "all" but this input can take any integer value. If maxint=3, then the
#' output will include contributions terms up to 3-way interactions.
#'
#' @param fixed.directional A true/false switch that allows the user to specify
#' whether a directional LTRE should be used. The default behavior is to calculate
#' a symmetric LTRE, where the mean matrix is used as the baseline matrix. See
#' details for more guidance.
#'
#' @return This returns a list object, with 3 items: (1) a vector of the matrix
#' indices where the parameters vary between/among the matrices in Aobj; (2) a
#' list of the indices varying for each of the contribution terms provided; (3)
#' a vector of the contribution terms.If the method is "fixed" then these are
#' contributions to the difference in lambda. If the method is "random" then
#' these are the contributions to the variance in lambda.
#'
#' `indices.varying` is a vector with the indices of parameters that vary. The
#'  numeric indices count down the columns of a given population projection
#'  matrix. For example, in a 3x3 matrix, the (2,2) position would be identified
#'  with a 5.
#'
#'  `varying.indices.list` is a list object, where each entry is a vector
#'  containing the indices (matching the `indices.varying` part of the output)
#'  that differed or varied for the corresponding entry in the `epsilon` vector.
#'
#'  `epsilon` is a vector of contributions to the variance or difference in
#'  lambda due to the observed values of the various life history parameters.
#'  For example, the contribution of adult survival to the Var(lambda) is
#'  determined by setting all parameters *except* adult survival to their mean
#'  values, and then calculating the variance of lambda across this manipulated
#'  set of matrices.
#'
#' @details  Lambda is the asymptotic population growth rate, defined as the
#'  largest eigenvalue of the population projection matrix.
#'
#'  In a one-way fixed design LTRE, the particular treatment levels or
#'  conditions faced by a population are of interest, so one-way fixed design
#'  LTRE decomposes the difference in lambda due to differences at each position
#'  of the matrices. For a fixed design LTRE, exactly 2 matrices must be
#'  provided.
#'
#'  A random design LTRE treats the different matrices being compared as random
#'  samples from a set of population conditions, without specific focus on the
#'  treatments or conditions that each population experienced. This analysis
#'  decomposes the variance in lambda due to variance and covariance in the
#'  entries at each position in the matrices. For a random design LTRE, at least
#'  2 matrices must be provided.
#'
#'  \code{fixed.directional=FALSE} is most appropriate for comparisons where
#'  none of the matrices are appropriate for use as a baseline or
#'  standard-of-reference. For example, if we want to ask which vital rates
#'  drive the difference in population growth rate for two populations of fish
#'  in separate but similar lakes, we want to use a *symmetric* analysis. In
#'  this case, the difference in lambda is decomposed using the mean matrix as
#'  the baseline. The decomposition is symmetric, meaning that if the treatment
#'  and reference matrix are swapped, the contributions from the vital rates
#'  will be equal in magnitude, but positive contributions will become negative
#'  and vice versa. In this case, it does not matter which order you provide the
#'  matrices in \code{Aobj}, but interpretation will require that you pay
#'  attention to the fact that the sum of contributions will be equal to the
#'  observed difference in lambda between the two matrices in \code{Aobj},
#'  evaluated as lambda(A1) - lambda(A2).
#'
#'  \code{fixed.directional=TRUE} is most appropriate for comparisons between a
#'  control and treatment population in a controlled experiment, or for other
#'  cases where one of the populations can serve as a standard of reference (for
#'  example, the lowest elevation population, or one near the range center). In
#'  this case, the first matrix in \code{Aobj} is used as the baseline. This is
#'  a directional analysis, meaning that if the order in which the two matrices
#'  are provided were to be swapped (switching the baseline matrix and other
#'  observed matrix), the contributions of the vital rates would change. If you
#'  choose a directional analysis, be sure to provide the matrices in
#'  \code{Aobj} ordered as `[baseline matrix, observed matrix`].
#'
#'  We set \code{fixed.directional=FALSE} as the default behavior because most
#'  population projection models are built with field-collected data rather than
#'  controlled experiment data.

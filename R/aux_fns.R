#' A function for variance assuming a complete sample
#'
#' The variance, assuming a complete sample, is the mean of the squared
#' deviations. When you assume an incomplete sample (the standard assumption in
#' statistics), the variance is calculated as the sum of squared deviations,
#' divided by (N-1), where N is the number of observations in the sample. As
#' such, the output of \code{variance_complete} will always be smaller than the
#' output of \code{var}.
#'
#' @param x A numeric vector that represents a complete sample.
#'
#' @return The variance of the entries of x, calculated with the assumption that
#' x represents a complete sample. Compare to the output of
#' \code{\link[stats]{var}}.
#' @export
#'
#' @seealso \code{\link[stats]{var}}
#'
#' @examples
#' test<- c(5, 6, 8, 10, 25)
#' Vc<- variance_complete(test)
#' # compare this output with that of var()
variance_complete <- function(x) {
  xx<- x[!is.na(x)]
  mean((xx - mean(xx))^2)
}

#' The variance-covariance matrix for a set of population projection matrices
#'
#' Calculate the variance-covariance matrix for the vital rates of a series of
#' population projection matrices.
#'
#' @param Aobj A matrix where each row is the column-wise vectorization of a
#' population projection matrix.
#'
#' @return The variance-covariance matrix for the vital rates of the population
#' projection matrices. If the dimensions of each matrix in \code{Aobj} are n-by-n,
#' then the variance-covariance matrix will have dimensions n^2-by-n^2.
#' @export
#'
#' @details The diagonal entries of the variance-covariance matrix give the
#' variance of the entries in each index of the matrix. The off-diagonal entries
#' of the variance-covariance matrix give the covariance of entries in each index
#' of the matrix. The variance-covariance matrix is symmetrical, and the
#' covariance of a given pair of vital rates is the sum of the two corresponding
#' indices.

# A function to compute the difference in lambda across a set of matrices, with some parameters fixed at their mean value:
#' Difference in lambda
#'
#' In population projection matrices, the eigenvalue with the largest magnitude

# Run matrix checks on an Aobj array (each row is a matrix, collapsed column-wise):
#' Automated checks for a set of matrices

#' Run automated checks for a set of population projection matrices. This code will
#' check if the matrices are square, strictly non-negative, ergodic, irreducible,
#' and primitive. The last check is for whether the column sums are greater than 1
#' for presumed survival terms. For this portion, the code assumes that the first
#' row represents only fertility, and that all other matrix entries represent
#' only survival.
#'
#' @param Aobj An object containing the population projection matrices to be
#'  included in the analysis. It should either be a list, or a matrix where each
#'  row is the column-wise vectorization of a matrix.

#' @return If all the checks pass, then nothing is returned. If one of the checks
#' fails, then an error or warning message will be returned.

\description{
The G-matrix is the operator used for calculating a vector of effects from a
vector of responses, up to arbitrary interaction order. This recursive function
for building up the G-matrix is presented in a paper about genetic epistasis
from Poelwijk, Krishna, and Ranganathan (2016, PLOS Comp Bio
\href{https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004771}{doi}). When the G-matrix is
multiplied on the right by a column vector of the observed responses, it will
produce a column vector of the effects. In other words, the G-matrix adds and
subtracts off the appropriate lower-order terms to arrive at the correct values
of interaction effects.

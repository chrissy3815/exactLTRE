\title{R0, the net reproductive output}
\usage{
r_nought(Amat, Fmat)
}
\arguments{
\item{Amat}{The full population projection matrix}

\item{Fmat}{The fertility elements of the population projection matrix.}
}
\value{
The net reproductive output, a single value, is the number of
offspring that an individual is expected to have over their lifespan.
}
\description{
R0, the net reproductive output
}
\details{
The net reproductive output is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix
product of the fertility matrix and the fundamental matrix. The fundamental
matrix, generally referred to as \strong{N}, contains the expected number of timesteps
that an individual will spend in each age, stage, or size class of the matrix.

\examples{
A1<- matrix(data=c(0,0.8,0, 0,0,0.7, 5,0,0.2), nrow=3, ncol=3)
F1<- matrix(0, nrow=3, ncol=3)
F1[1,3]<- A1[1,3]
#F1 is all zeros, except the upper right corner which matches A1 for adult fertility
R0<- r_nought(A1, F1)

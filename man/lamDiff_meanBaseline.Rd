\title{Difference in lambda, with a mean baseline}
\usage{
lamDiff_meanBaseline(Aobj, which.fixed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Aobj}{An object containing the population projection matrices to be
included in the analysis. It should either be a list, or a matrix where each
row is the column-wise vectorization of a matrix. Exactly 2 matrices should be
provided. If more than 2 matrices are provided, the function will assume
that the first is the reference and the second is the test matrix.}

\item{which.fixed}{The column-wise indices (single-value index) of the vital
rates to be held at their mean values across the matrices in \code{Aobj}.}
}
\value{
A single value for the difference in lambda.
}
\description{
In population projection matrices, the eigenvalue with the largest magnitude
is the asymptotic population growth rate, referred to as lambda. This function
calculates the difference in lambda between two population projection
matrices, which must have the same dimensions. This function also has the option
to hold some of the vital rates at their mean values across the provided
matrices. The resulting calculation is the difference in lambda when all the
non-fixed vital rates are varying. For example, if all the vital rates are
held fixed except for adult fertility, then the output is the difference in
lambda due to difference in adult fertility. The difference is taken as
\eqn{reference matrix - test matrix}, and the function assumes that the
provided matrices are ordered [reference, test].
}
\details{
This function differs from \code{lamDiff} because it uses the mean
matrix as the baseline. So fixed parameters are set to their mean values. In
\code{lamDiff}, the fixed parameters would be set to their respective values
given by the reference matrix.

\code{lamDiff} is most appropriate for comparisons between a control and treatment
population in a controlled experiment. \code{lamDiff_meanBaseline} is more
appropriate for comparisons where it is not entirely obvious which population
should be the reference and which should be the test (for example, when
comparing a wet and a dry year).

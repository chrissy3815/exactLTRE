* This is a new release. This package was previously released on CRAN but was removed due to outdated Author contact information.
* Code is unchanged from previous CRAN relase v 0.1.0, but Author contact info is corrected to a stable e-mail address, and the description now includes updated references.
* The note in R CMD check is 'unable to verify current time' - this is an issue with my local computer.

# exactLTRE

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of exactLTRE is to provide a set of friendly tools to increase use of 
exact LTRE methods. Life Table Response Experiments are a valuable tool for 
advancing our knowledge about how stage-specific vital rates influence population
dynamics. The results of LTRE's also inform conservation goals, by identifying 
the life stage and vital rate (for example, juvenile survival or adult reproductive
success) that have the largest impact on population growth rate.

The standard methods of LTRE, presented in the Caswell (2001) textbook, are based
on approximations and are vulnerable to mistakes both due to the approximation of
specific terms and the fact that higher-order terms are neglected from the analyses.
Exact LTRE avoids errors of interpretation by directly calculating the impact on
population growth rate of differences or variation in vital rates. With the 
improved computing power that we have today, we no longer need to rely on 
approximation methods that can be faulty. 

This package includes functions for the approximate methods as well as the exact
methods that we introduce. This will allow researchers to use both the methods
that are standard in the literature up until now (2021), and the new methods that
we encourage as a new standard.

## Installation

You can install the development version of exactLTRE from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("chrissy3815/exactLTRE")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(exactLTRE)
## basic example code
```

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
